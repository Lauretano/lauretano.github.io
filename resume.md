##Profile

##Experience
###Zillow Group; Seattle, WA and New York, NY 2012-Present
####Lead Systems Architect 2014-Present
####Senior Systems Engineer 2013
####Windows Systems administrator 2012
* As IT Manager of our New York office (2014-2016), grew the 3-person IT team in the New York office, mentoring and training the staff that supported the 300 person office. Contributed to the StreetEasy acquisition by leading most of the corporate IT integration projects.
* Produced our Mac management solution, managing about 2000 macOS devices and 300 iOS devices using Jamf Pro on a dozen Ubuntu LTS Linux hosts running Apache Tomcat and MySQL across nine offices.
* Introduced video conferencing to the company, which grew to include over 200 room systems as well as 5000+ desktop/mobile devices together in an integrated solution. Dramatically increased inter-office communication at geographically-dispersed company.
* Eliminated a major user pain point by implementing ADFS as a single sign on solution, but quickly outgrew it. Selected Okta as a replacement, implemented it, and grew our use to support over 200 SSO-enabled applications used by over 3500 people. Okta consistently has one of the highest user satisfaction scores out of all major IT projects in user surveys.
* Introduced the latest messaging tech to the company via a few smooth messaging platform switches. Went from IRC/OpenFire to Lync, from Lync to HipChat, and from HipChat to Slack. Placed a heavy focus on user training and support, writing training materials, conducting group training sessions, writing the internal communications, and holding workshops with non-tech teams to identify Slack apps and other integrations that could empower their groups.
* Eliminated antiquated and isolated Windows and Linux certificate authorities, replacing them with a central hierarchy (Windows-based with offline root), which went on to be used as the central CA for all groups in the company in addition to use for network authentication by desktops and mobile devices.
